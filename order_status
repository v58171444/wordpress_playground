/**
* There is an issue with a code here. I am not a programmer (maybe just yet... hopefully), however the code provided

* the order plus some custom notes (if any). 
* Once I put the code (safe for me, using CodeSnippets) it stopped redirecting to the 'Order Received' page and
* started redirecting to cart.

* should. So, please, Help. =)))
* The code follows:
